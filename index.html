    <h1>Generative and Predictive AI for Improved Industrial Processes</h1>
    <h2>Project by: Aryaman Singh Dev</h2>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>
            This project addresses long-standing challenges in the manufacturing industry, including operational inefficiencies, high maintenance costs, quality control issues, and decision-making complexities. The core objective was to leverage SymphonyAI's advanced AI platforms to deliver tangible improvements. By utilizing both Predictive AI (PredAI) for forecasting trends and failures  and Generative AI (GenAI) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance operator efficiency, the project demonstrated a clear path to optimizing industrial operations. The work involved the practical application of tools like the IRIS Workspace, Predictive Asset Intelligence, and Vision AI  to create scalable solutions. Key outcomes focused on reducing unscheduled asset downtime, improving process efficiency, and enhancing connected worker operations, ultimately leading to a significant return on investment through increased throughput and energy efficiency.

        <h3>My Contribution</h3>
        <p>
            As an intern at SymphonyAI, I was deeply involved in the end-to-end data science lifecycle across multiple client projects, applying theoretical knowledge to solve practical industrial problems. My specific contributions include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>P&ID Digitization and Validation:</strong> I played a key role in the Piping & Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) ingestion project. This involved manually inspecting diagrams to identify and document errors and misclassifications (e.g., incorrect bounding boxes, double detections) in the underlying JSON data. I corrected these files to improve the accuracy of the automated P&ID ingestor software before it was tested.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Multi-Client Data Analysis & Anomaly Detection:</strong> I worked on diverse datasets for several clients, including TDK, Centrifugal (CF), and UR. My responsibilities included comprehensive data preprocessing—such as resampling, handling NaNs, and removing outliers using statistical methods like Inter-Quartile Range (IQR) and Z-score. For the Centrifugal use case, I utilized the MLOps Studio to conduct Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) and run the Anomaly Detection Engine (ADE).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Platform and Tool Proficiency:</strong> I developed strong technical skills across SymphonyAI’s proprietary platforms, including the IRIS Foundry, Kubeflow for confidential code development, and the DTS AI Studio. I used Visual Paradigm to create new P&ID diagrams from scratch  and utilized Postman extensively for API testing (GET, POST actions) to ensure proper data communication between tenant dashboards and the backend.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Visualization and Reporting:</strong> To deliver actionable insights, I created a variety of visualizations using Python libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn), including date-wise boxplots and overlapping histograms to compare variables across different machines and datasets. These visuals were crucial for identifying trends and communicating findings effectively.
